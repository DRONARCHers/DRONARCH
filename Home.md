## What is DRONARCH
In archaeology data acquirement and visualization is key. Often it is hard to capture 3-dimensional structures appropriately, especially if the dig covers a large area.
So the idea of using 3D models is obvious, but acquiring the data and modeling can not be done efficient manually.
Drones seem to be a good solution to this challenge and are affordable as well.
DRONARCH is a structure from motion application developed for this purpose and takes its source images from videos from drones and additional images.

### How did it start
This is a project for the for the research group _Archäologie der Römischen Provinzen_ of the _Institut für Archäologische Wissenschaften_ at the University of Bern as part of my bachelor's studies.

### Where is it now

A first version of the report is done and can be found [here](https://github.com/DRONARCHers/DRONARCH/blob/master/report/tex/dronarch.pdf).

The images to the intermediate results can be found in [the corresponding subfolder of results](https://github.com/DRONARCHers/DRONARCH/tree/master/results)

### Where does it go
For now this is just a small project for University.
There are some more ideas about the usage of IT in archaeology around and I hope to start some further projects in the near future.
