## What is DRONARCH
In archaeology data acquirement and visualization is key. Often it is hard to capture 3-dimensional structures appropriately, especially if the dig covers a large area.
So the idea of using 3D models is obvious, but acquiring the data and modeling can not be done efficient manually.
Drones seem to be a good solution to this challenge and are affordable as well.
DRONARCH is a structure from motion application developed for this purpose and takes its source images from videos from drones and additional images.

### How did it start
This is a project for the for the research group _Archäologie der Römischen Provinzen_ of the _Institut für Archäologische Wissenschaften_ at the University of Bern as part of my bachelors studies.

### Where is it now
Development has just started

### Where does it go
For now this is just a small project for University
