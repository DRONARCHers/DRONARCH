A lot of work  has been done so far and a lot more will be done the next few weeks. Here's a short overview

### So far and problems
The main pipeline is now (18.12.14) implemented but results are still very bad. I think I will have to tweak the usage of the intrinsic camera parameters in bundler.
The dense point cloud is basically still just noise. Here my guess is, that the camera position estimated in the bundle adjustment is not good enough. I will try to fix that.
In the meanwhile I'm not sure if the video I've used for testing was good enough.

### What's next
So I will focus on the drone control to get some good images myself and then tweak the capture and reconstruction process together.

### Results
Images will follow soon.
