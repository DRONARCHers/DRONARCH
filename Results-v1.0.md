The first version of the DROANRCH report is done.

### Droneless
I had to cut off the drones and work only with the manually taken images, because the software used for controlling the drone and creating the PTAM map was nod robust enough and the image quality to poor.
So I had to choose a new working title, which is now: **Digital Reconstruction Of Natural Environment and Archaeological and Cultural Heritage using Structure from Motion** (I practised so hard to remember and pronounce it correctly^^)

### Report
The report in v1.0 can be found [here](https://github.com/DRONARCHers/DRONARCH/blob/master/report/tex/dronarch.pdf).
It is not the final report, but university needs some results already.

### Agisoft PhotoScan
It turned out, that our lab owns a licence for PhotoScan, which does the exact same thing as DRONARCH and does it way better (unfortunately *grrr*).
I uploaded some of these results on [sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/dronarch).

### What's next
I will try to further improve my results and take more image sets for reconstructions. I hope the weather will be fine for some nice day trips through Switzerland to visit some (archaeologically) nice places.

### Results
Some images from the report, just because there are no images on this page yet.
